"aren't you the one who's exaggerating ( •̀ - •́ ) ? but thanks? i never knew my dying rat voice would be the most heavenly voice on earth. well, a dying rat sounds like... hmmm i bet you've never hunted rats in your house? ฅ( •̀ ᵕ •́ ฅ )"
- I will never exaggerate, of course. I only ever tell plain accurate fact. (づ￣ 3￣)づ True, I've never played Tom and Jerry in my house... sounds fun though, you know, will you be the Jerry to my Tom? 😳

"i see. you know, i always love when you recommend me stuff. i knew it'd be great and i'd love it too... you're so cool and awesome (૭ ｡•̀ ᵕ •́｡ )૭ by the way, you played ace attorney? i've never tried it although i've been seeing it everywhere on the blue bird app."
- No, YOU're so cool and awesome. (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧I also love whenever you recommend me stuff too! I always immediately check it out and I end up loving it. (´▽`ʃ♡ƪ) People all over Twitter's playing Ace Attorney on 2022? THAT'S MY CHILDHOOD GAME actually I used to play it on Nintendo DS back when I was on elementary school. A lovely game series I must say, and I still love Maya Fey to this day, she's one adorable dork. You should try playing it.
Oh wait I just remembered about the bot-rendered Ace Attorney gameplay on Twitter. Like whenever there's a long thread of multiple people arguing you can always tag the bot and make the bot render the whole argument in Ace Attorney gameplay for you. Is that what you mean? φ(゜▽゜*)♪

"or... you could borrow the book from me? ( •⌄• )✧ you know? saving money and energy. umm, reading slump? isn't a reader's block like me blocking your view from reading? absolutely joking, both are fine i guess. ah, alright, copy that sir! and sure, sure, look forward to it okay? (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧"
- RIGHT why didn't that cross my mind before? I could simply borrow the book for you, what a simple solution. I'll fly to your house later. o(*^▽^*)┛ Yeah that's definitely reader's block alright. But you're always blocking my view no matter what I'm doing, actually. Like I always got distracted by your cuteness. Nevermind, that's cheesy. Okay! Thrilled to hear your thoughts about it. ╰(*°▽°*)╯ I'll also give it a second read later.

"every hour, minute, second? are you sure that won't be me spamming? i feel like i'd be a freak, or a weirdo if i do so. plus, the webpage might crash too......."
- That would be you spamming indeed, but that's one thousand percent fine. You'll never seem like a freak or a weirdo to me, come on. And well....... about that. Good point. I don't know the database's limitation though, but as long as you don't send a heavy chunk of data I reckon it should be fine. Like I've said, abuse the webpage!!!!1!!11!!1!1!!1!!1! ψ(｀∇´)ψ(≧∇≦)ﾉ\^o^/

"i see. so happy that we share the same favorite album from them! um, what other kpop groups did you use to listen to? if i may ask? ( •̤ ꒳ •̤ ) well... not that aegyo... but nevermind, that's cute too. oh, sure you can't do aegyos. i guess you're cute by nature, you don't need to act cute because you're already cute. makes so much sense (๑•̀ㅁ•́๑)✧"
- Thing is.... I never really listened to any full discography of KPop groups except for iKon...... ((embarrassed)) But songs & albums that I remember I liked back then was:
a) Vixx's Eau de Vixx
b) TVXQ's Dominus (still lowkey jamming to it)
c) Red Velvet's Peek-a-Boo & Power Up (lol)
d) Defsoul's mixtapes
e) Nu'Est W's Who, You (one of the fella on this group looks bloody pretty)
f) BTS' 134340 & Wings (their fanbase are scary)
I recently discovered GOT7's You Calling My Name so I don't know if this counts, but hey it's catchy.

All of these are the songs & albums that I remembered at the moment, I'll give my old Spotify account a look later. Pretty sure there are a LOT more than this.

No. I'm not cute and I can't do any aegyos because I'm not cute, that's the actual answer. ヽ（≧□≦）ノ

"yes, there are. you're just too humble to even notice. they have a fanbase for you, in fact, i'm the founder. WELLLLL, then what about, i don't know… your exes?? ໒( ˵ •̀ □ •́ ˵ ) no way they have never called you sweet and cute and adorable. i'm not sweet and cute and adorable, i'm only acting ૮₍ ˃ ⤙ ˂ ₎ა yeah, you are a very cute seemingly serious person to me, the cutest of its kind. and people would fall for you once they know you ( ｰ̀εｰ́ )"
- You're the founder??? Please don't indoctrinate people out with the myth that I am cute because I'm not cute at all and that'll be a huge problem. ～(　TロT)σ I laughed so hard, yeah, fair enough, my exes told me I'm sweet and cute and adorable. But with all due respect they always burn their omelettes, I never believed them. You're only acting? With this ૮₍ ˃ ⤙ ˂ ₎ა adorable and cute and sweet kaomoji that fits you perfectly? Come on!! And I'm the least cutest of my kind, you can't be serious. ( ｰ̀εｰ́ )

"i giggled so hard. ok, that might sound like a truth, but it strongly smells like a burnt omelette.... you know? haha, alright, alright, cutie, just kidding. my fault it is then. but again, please do not hesitate to tell me if i someday bother you or something ₍ᐡ｡っ ̫-｡ᐡ₎ anyway, don't thank me!! i've always wanted to be your mood booster, a person who makes you smile at least. but thank you very much, i hope i won't burden you with that."
- I'm a decent cook, perhaps the smell's coming from your kitchen?? And. No, it's not your fault, it's my cat's fault. Blame it all on him. ( •̀ ω •́ ) Sure, I;ll let you know. But you know what, you'll never bother me and I'll never find you annoying and such. Of course you won't burden me with that! I'll start sending you cute stuff or memes on Monday. To cheer you up, to brighten up your day... stay tuned. φ(゜▽゜*)♪
