I am in the same class as this one girl. We share the same wavelength in terms of humour taste so we're platonically close since I'm often the only one who understands whenever she cracks joke in class, which is somewhat sad honestly.

There's this one day when we were walking together side-by-side after class, both on our way to the parking lot, it was I recall on 6pm-ish. We were facing the open area behind our uni so we could see the sunset. Tell you what, the sunset was indeed truly beautiful, sucks that my phone battery died at that moment that I couldn't took a pic of it.

So she brought it to my attention, saying "hey, look at the sky!"

I simply agreed with a "yeah I know" or something along the lines. I was busy watching the sky too in fact. So we kept walking in silence before suddenly a random thought popped in my brain. I suddenly remembered the sentence "the sunset is beautiful isn't it?" which I thought was some kind of a meme or an iconic sentence from a film lmao yeah I need to bury me head in the sand. So I obviously said it to her, thinking that she might respond with a laugh.

Nah. Instead, she responded with a "!?!?!?! (ʘᴥʘ) are you proposing me???? haha just kidding...."

I was practically totally truly dumbfounded by that response that it got me at a loss of words. So I simply answered with "of course not?" pretending as if I wasn't confused by her answer, while in reality man that answer confused the hell out of me.

She proceeded by saying "you know, I much prefer the 'the moon is beautiful isn't it' version". Which left me even more confused since I know 'the moon is beautiful isn't it' is another way of saying 'I love you'. I responded with "yeah, too bad it's still 6pm... what does the sunset is beautiful even means, anyway?"

"I love you!" she said.

"Oh. ...bruh." Bad answer I know, my brain stopped responding at that moment.

We fell completely silent after that.
