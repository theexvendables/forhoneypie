Hellooo, the bestestest, cutestest, sweetestest comfort person ever! ‚úß‚Å†\‚Å†(‚Å†>‚Å†o‚Å†<‚Å†)‚Å†Ôæâ‚Å†‚úß I‚Äôm fine and life‚Äôs all good! This week is a breeze, I‚Äôm free of afternoon classes almost everyday. Apparently since the professor‚Äôs busy (yay) attending conferences or something. Not sure about next week though.

Thank you very much, I won‚Äôt! Yes, we indeed got this. Fighting for both of us. (‡´≠ ÔΩ°‚Ä¢ÃÄ ·µï ‚Ä¢ÃÅÔΩ° )‡´≠  Don‚Äôt worry, your messages don‚Äôt bother me at all! I love reading them. And replying to them. I only reply to them when I have free time too, so don‚Äôt worry about that. And no time wasted at all - just time spent doing important stuff. üòÅ I won‚Äôt call spending my time on Honey Pie as ‚Äúwasting‚Äù my time, so, no. You too, take a rest if you‚Äôre tired, okay?

I laughed so hard, yeah, thank you broadcaster!!! For introducing us to our new soulmate anthem. You got back home at 9???? That‚Äôs... heck, you must be very tired,  I always get back home at around 4 everyday so that sounds very tiring, hope you‚Äôre healthy and all good? And I hope today‚Äôs treating you better. Please get enough rest. (‚Å†¬†‚Å†Ôºõ‚Å†‚àÄ‚Å†Ôºõ‚Å†) Anyway, it‚Äôs totally fine to not occasionally update here! Just use this page when you feel like doing it. Whenever you want to rant, whenever you want to tell me about your day, et cetera. I‚Äôve missed you moooooreeeeee. ‡ºº‚Å†;‚Å†¬¥‚Å†‡ºé‡∫∂‚Å†¬†‚Å†€ù¬†‚Å†‡ºé‡∫∂‚Å†‡ºΩ   God this kaomoji‚Äôs horrendous. Accurate though.

I know right... my friends are also surprised whenever I told them I was into K-Pop back in my early teenager years. They all gave me a weird look and said ‚Äúmate what?‚Äù since I strongly don‚Äôt seem like a guy that would enjoy K-Pop songs. To be fair the Hallyu Wave was literally everywhere and I listened to one catchy song and got hooked (lmao). Back then I used to listen to iKon, their tunes are all unique. I recall that my favourite iKon song was Perfect (that‚Äôs the title). Typing this while listening to it.... man, reminds me of my cringy teenager phase, so it kinda traumatised me too also. But to be frank, can‚Äôt deny that those are fun days though. And that‚Äôs not so cute of me, come on man! Wait no, I mean come on cutie!!

Bloody ell that‚Äôs long, anyways.

I laughed so hard. Noooo, I‚Äôm not lying! I‚Äôm a terrible myth-teller so I won‚Äôt tell any myths. I haven‚Äôt been called sweet before. The consequence of being a seemingly serious person, probably? Ôºº‚Å†(Ôæü‚Å†ÔΩ∞Ôæü‚Å†Ôºº‚Å†) And that‚Äôs such a big honour, thaaank you very much! Reading that makes me grateful of the day I decided to create this page. But man, want me to be that so called fancy car though. I will never rust. Ah, I made this webpage for about three days - working around the base and designing it on day one, coding the back-end on day two, and finishing plus sending it to you on day three. Quite a simple process, and the coding itself is fairly simple too, so it doesn‚Äôt take me too long to finish. Also I was very truly free back then. Uni hasn‚Äôt yet started.

No waaaay, you didn‚Äôt and don‚Äôt and won‚Äôt bother me at all. Please believe me. ü•∫ü•∫ It‚Äôs a-okay to paste a link here too, and feel free to ask me anything! No such thing as too many questions.

Damn. Makes sense. I wanna CMS too. I agree, coding is hard and I‚Äôm not genius nor skilled. Heh, okaaay. You‚Äôre genius and skilled though, Einstein, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll learn quicker than anyone else. (‚Å†Ôæâ‚Å†‚óï‚Å†„ÉÆ‚Å†‚óï‚Å†)‚Å†Ôæâ‚Å†*‚Å†.‚Å†‚úß

My pleasure! I laughed so hard, hope your professor didn‚Äôt notice though?? With due respect, if they happened to notice and mentioned it to you I‚Äôd say do not hesitate to bang-bang them in the head. To get rid of embarrassment. No, just kidding, that‚Äôs horrible. Indeed, our new soulmate anthem confirmed!! Can‚Äôt thank that one radio broadcaster enough.

That‚Äôs nice! You could rest easy then. I was busy with uni but I‚Äôm free now, I think it‚Äôs about 9pm over your place the moment I‚Äôm typing this. I‚Äôm currently listening to Ian Brown‚Äôs Corpses In Their Mouths. I‚Äôm bringing a John Grisham book with me and I was reading it two hours ago. Not sure when you‚Äôll open this page again, but hiiii what about you, wyd the moment you‚Äôre reading this? (‚Å†¬†‚Å†‚óú‚Å†‚Äø‚Å†‚óù‚Å†¬†‚Å†)‚Å†‚ô°

Today‚Äôs treating me nicely so far, thank you very much! Hope today treated you nicely too, and I hope everything goes well with you as well! Sure, I will, you too okay? Please feel free to send me as much messages as you want, don‚Äôt be sorry. I‚Äôm all ears for you too. Oh also, you don‚Äôt have to reply to all these. Hope you‚Äôre having a peaceful night right now, see ya. ‚äÇ‚Å†(‚Å†‚Ä¢‚Å†‚Äø‚Å†‚Ä¢‚Å†‚äÇ‚Å†‚Å†)‚Å†*‚Å†.‚Å†‚úß

Update: I just read your recent message. Love you moreee. You too, get some rest, okay? Don‚Äôt stay up late. The kaomoji‚Äôs showing up just fine. And it‚Äôs cute. Sent by a cute person too. (‚Å†„Å•‚Å†Ôø£‚Å†¬†‚Å†¬≥‚Å†Ôø£‚Å†)‚Å†„Å•
