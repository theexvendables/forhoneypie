"i'm totally completely healthy now! although i've had another fever for the last few days (yes maybe i indeed have poor physical health), thanks! alright... but honestly my biggest fear is that you'll go "ugh, this person again" at the end of the day. oh, really? your brother and i are the same then. i often whine to everyone about it (except you), mostly to my friend. BUT right, i sound very healthy and cute, right."
- Glad to hear that you're back in shape! Also please don't ever think that way, I'll never think "ugh, this person again", I'll always go "oh it's honey pie!!!!" at the end of the day for real for real. You INDEED sound very healthy and cute. （〃｀ 3′〃） Glad that you've finally came to the self-awareness. 

"but hey, wanna move into an empty house in front of my house?? mine isn't very far from the cinema :3"
- YEAH. I really want to. Amen. 🛐

"it's already saturday, soo did you watch it? noo i'm not scared at all! in fact, i enjoyed it very much. watching a horror movie in the cinema alone gotta be one of the best experiences i've ever had, it was so surreal. but also funny when i went out of the studio and my friends were over there clapping as i approach them. like, yeah, i'm the bravest, now where's the award you cowards. just kidding. but you should try it too!! are you brave enough~? or should i also fly to your house? ૮₍｡´ᴖ ˔ ᴖ｡₎ა"
- Unfortunately not yet! I'll watch it on Sunday night though. I've taken interest on Smile since last July so it's one of my top anticipated films, I'm sure that it'll be a great watch since Honey Pie also said it is. Anyway I can totally see why they're clapping though. Last time I watched a horror film alone on cinema was last June and I don't think I would like to experience it again. The loud sounds startled me a lot. Challenge accepted, let's see if I'm brave enough. (•ˋ _ ˊ•)

"you were eating ramen while replying? that explains the semicolon in the last paragraph then (｡◠ ꇴ ◠｡ ) nevermind, i was just teasing. don't be sorry, it's fine ٩(•̤̀ᵕ•̤́๑)ᵒᵏ"
- I remember I was truly embarrassed when I read this back then. Not my proudest moment. ฅʕ•̫͡•ʔฅ no thoughts brain empty

"he is indeed random, very random. he sounded very grumpy that night, so one of my friends told him to be patient and you know what, he replied through the zoom chat precisely like this: "Always patient in my heart" with a rock eyebrow raise emoji. the atmosphere suddenly changed right quick and i had to turn off my camera to laugh 〒▽〒 what does that even mean..."
- CAN I HAVE YOUR LECTURER??? He sounds so random in a precious way. All my lecturer is so tense especially my calculus lecturer. It's kind of 😁😀😄😆🤗 y'know.

"oh, speaking of safe space, i wonder if you receive a notification every time i send a message here...?"
- I think you're still curious about this, but actually no. I don't receive any notification every time you send a message on here. I just open the database for your messages every day to check whether or not you submitted a new message. Much of a hassle but I don't know, I just think I don't need a notification to open your messages. I mean I'll always be opening it every day, so. =￣ω￣= what's interesting is that I recently found out that I can use Tele to send messages to my Tele account every time there's a new message from you. But nah. I much prefer my method now.

"but oh, i remember growing up playing sega's rhythm game, hatsune miku: project diva f 2nd. love the game so much! my favorite song is gotta be "i'll miku-miku you", it's a catchy, cute fun song >< and i think it was the only song that i score perfectly on extreme mode... i suppose you know the game series?"
- Ah, I don't! Embarrassing. The only game that crosses my mind when I read the word Sega is Sonic. But I do know Miku, I was kinda having a Vocaloid phase too back in elementary school. I was deep-diving in the horror Vocaloid songs, it was somewhat fun reading the theories and speculations in the comments. I'll Miku-Miku You sounds so cute indeed. Hold on, let me search it on Youtube.

"but yes, would you be my personal book reader? just kidding, i read the first chapter when i was about to sleep, but then i accidentally fell asleep. i'll try to finish the first chapter on sunday while listening to the loving you so playlist. or the 21 02 one."
- I laughed so hard. Fine with me, I'll gladly be your personal book reader. (❤´艸｀❤)

"that is zero fine... you would actually be annoyed, i'm afraid. like I've said earlier. and... do you think i will believe that "You'll never seem like a freak or a weirdo to me"??? there must be a time where i look like a cringe, freak weirdo to you :< but it's okay to be honest about it :>"
- You'll never look like a cringe, freak weirdo to you. No capping here. But okay, if that's not convincing enough for you, if you're a cringe freak weirdo then I'm a cringe freak weirdo too. We're on the same lane. （づ￣3￣）づ╭❤～

"oh, yeah, i assume you were talking about ren? the nu'est one? i'm laughing so hard right now."
- YEAH THAT'S THE GUY he's so pretty I often mistook him as a girl.

"and YES, YES, got7's you calling my name is a great, catchy song. though i used to dislike the song due to it being overplayed by my aunt. but ah, i'd like to thank her for introducing me to got7's forever young :3 my childhood song. have you listened to that one yet?"
- Your aunt sounds cool. My aunt barely even listen to music, which is kind of sad. I think I've listened to Forever Young back then... I forgot, I'll listen to it later. Is your aunt an Ahgase by any chance? 

"communicating here is already enough to give me serotonin and emotional support actually (⁠ ⁠◜⁠‿⁠◝⁠ ⁠)⁠♡ (i miss texting you on tele though)"
- Feel free to text me on Tele! It's free real estate. Although I don't really use Tele nowadays but still, if you want to text me on Tele I'm there. I'm always here, there, and everywhere for you. (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧

"i don't mind at all! well she's now been adopted by my cousin's girlfriend :"3 she's bubu actually... the one you're interested in. sorry, i'd happily give you bubu if only we lived that cloooehsuhse (⁠ ⁠；⁠∀⁠；⁠)"
- BUBU NOOOOOOOOO 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔 but okay! I think she'll be happier if she's being taken care of by your cousin's girlfriend instead of me. I'm not that wholesome of an owner. I'm talking like this as if we actually live clohsuehsuheshhehshdhehdbhdhueueueueue. That's the main problem to begin with.

"the fourth clip still makes me wheeze to this very day and i don't understand why i find it hilarious: https://youtu.be/xVHEz2xfgBU"
- That's literally the funniest clip amongst the other clips (although the other clips is also funny too I grinned widely watching the last one the silence is so loud). I MEAN THAT WAS SO UNEXPECTED KSJDKJSKJDKSBD I can see that the girl is being annoying but it would never came to my mind that the guy would make her kiss his armpit what the ell

"these are not a compilation, but watch them! https://youtube.com/shorts/OSs1sCwR9H0?feature=share, https://youtu.be/yOPrOgymETc"
- THE FIRST VIDEO LMAOOOOO the typo "chromoz" makes it a thousand times better.
The second video I WAS BEING SERIOUS I got interested until the very end for what I got caught off guard. Got me for the most part. I love reading the comments btw it's such a shame that I can't put images here 😕
