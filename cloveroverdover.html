            HELLO!!! And welcome to your Christmas gift. I apologise that the gift doesn't look Christmassy at all, it's just that I can't design with vibrant colours (I highkey hate vibrant colours) and that I'm afraid red-plus-green-and-white-yadda-yadda coloured webpage would hurt our eyes both. I mean, those colours are way too basic, mate. Also I'm afraid the page would look like a commercial brand advertising Christmas and Year End Sale discounts if I do use them. So I took a different approach. Hope you're okay with it?<br><br>To think of it, I should've chosen a cheerful romantic song instead of Clover Over Dover. üòÄ But nevermind. I'll make a cute webpage for you one day. Remind me.<br><br>While creating this page, I cannot stop reminiscing to our anniversary day. You gave me a presentation file and I remember I watched it all throughout the 21st February. I thought of making you a presentation file too, but honestly my Microsoft PowerPoint-ing skill sucks... so I created this instead.<br><br>Anyway, here's your Christmas gifts.

            I've taken three of these quite a while back. I think they look beautiful so I thought of sharing these with you. Enjoy the scenery. ·Éö(‚ïπ‚ó°‚ïπ·Éö)<br><br><br>
            <a id="loveletter" class="gift">Love Letter</a><br>
            Hello there, soulmate.<br><br>
            I ran out of ideas for what gift that I should make for you, and I think a love letter might do. I do hope it suffice. I would've bought you pizza or candies if we live close. ‚ïØÔ∏ø‚ï∞<br><br>
            So anyways, since this is a love letter, I might as well start by saying I love you. I haven't told you this in a while, but that doesn't mean I love you less than I used to, of course. I will always love you, and I love you more each day.<br><br>
            Damn that's cringe. But I mean it. >:)<br><br>
            Also, I'm happy that I met you. This is not my first time having an Internet friend, but you surely stand out from the rest because you're not only a friend but also a soulmate to me.<br><br>
            God, how does one write a non-cringy love letter?<br><br>
            But anyway, it's almost two years since we first know each other. We've come a long way.<br><br>
            Thank you for being the kindest, cutest, gorgeous-est, breathtaking-est person I've ever met. The people around you are so lucky they get to meet you everyday though, and I envy them for that. (;¬¥‡ºé‡∫∂–î‡ºé‡∫∂`) you know, WHYYYYY don't we live close?<br><br>
            I honestly have no idea what to type because I have a real lot to unpack when it comes to term of telling how I feel to you, but let me just say that I'm truly lucky to meet you. The way we met is just so random, but who would have known that we would be soulmates after that? Universe works in a fascinating way, the proof being I met you.<br><br>
            Also you're the funniest person I've ever met, you're not cringe come on. If you never grow tired of saying that you're cringe, I won't ever grow tired of convincing you the other way. ( ÔπÅ ÔπÅ ) ~‚Üí<br><br>
            By the way, I do hope that we can stay soulmates until eternity. Having you around already feels so normal, yet I know damn well that it would hurt so bad if I ever lose you. Might sound selfish, but would you mind if I ask you to not go anywhere?<br><br>
            Also, thank you for being the most understanding person I've ever met. I agree that we should not justify the way I act before. I'm also not proud of how I acted. You're too kind saying that it is understandable in other perspective, yet I hold myself accountable - I wasn't being fair. Sorry that I hurt you, hurts me reading that you think you didn't deserve an explanation from me. Truth is, I care about you a lot. And I know you care about me just the same. I just don't want to burden you with not-so-joyful stuffs I've went through, so I decided to back off and disappear... not a wise decision.<br><br>
            Thank you very much for telling me how you feel, I truly appreciate it and I totally get how you're feeling. If I were put in your position I would be very upset too.<br><br>
            I hope you know that whatever happens, I'll still love you all the same. You still mean a lot to me.<br><br>
            I think that's all I have to say, I hope this is a good piece of "love letter" though honestly I feel like it is written poorly but oh well I spent hours thinking of words I should say to you so it couldn't be that bad...... I hope.<br><br>
            I can't possibly thank you enough for everything you've done. But really, thank you very much. I love you so much too.<br><br>
            See you around!<br><br>
